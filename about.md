I am a passionate computer science student, currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am interested in working with latest technology, building applications, learning computer science oriented stuff. I love tweaking with computers. I like to work on projects and open source projects, contribute to open source community in any way. Though currently I have little experience contributing to open source but I love to do this and I hope in future I can replace this text with 'open source hacker'.

## About the Website

Its good to have one website hosted on public servers. And if you have no business to do over the internet, so you can have blog which expose your life to
the outside world.

The website if made by using jekyll and some of the tweaking that I did with it. I love it. You can read my post about starting with jekyll in the blog archive if you are interested in creating such a website I have created, it takes no more than a day to fully 
setup your jekyll website and I really like it. Well in this website I have thought of putting as much posts as possible. Everyday I learn something new, so why not share all these learnings with you.

If you like this website, please consider sharing it. If not much atleast I can get more visitors/day. :)
